The Latest Version is 1.11 [6/29/2022]

I tightened up the ship movement control (it's no longer frame based).

I added automatic firing as an option.  Push left or right on the title screen to turn it on or off.  The game will default back to 'off' when turned on, reset, or the game ends.

Your ship is reset to the bottom dock area when it explodes.

The astronaut at the top of the screen will now move back and forth and is animated.

Bonuses were added.  If you rescue at least 4 spacemen on a single ship, you will receive a 300 point bonus after the oxygen is depleted on the ship you're on.  If you rescue 8 or more, there is a 600 point bonus. 

Rescuing an astronaut (picking him up and taking him to the bottom dock area) will now give you a small oxygen bonus, increasing the time you have available on the ship.
The security gate will flash when you are getting low on oxygen, so you have an additional visual indicator when the time is almost up.

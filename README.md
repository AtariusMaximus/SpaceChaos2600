It's an intergalactic rescue mission!  Your job, should you choose to accept it, is to rescue as many trapped astronauts as possible from our fleet of nine ships.  Each ship has a limited supply of oxygen represented by the meter at the top of the screen.  Rescue as many astronauts as you can before it runs out, once the oxygen meter gets all the way to the right you will be transported to the next ship.

Using your specially equipped fighter, you can enter the federation ship and rise through the tunnels to the eighth floor to get to the trapped astronauts.  You can only carry one at a time. Once you pick them up, transport them back to the bottom docking area and they will exit the ship for rescue. In your path is a security system gone awry, you'll need to shoot and/or avoid the regulators and completely avoid the moving security doors.  Regulators will be regenerated after a period of time, so be careful.  Security Doors cannot be destroyed and must be avoided. You will receive 10 points for each Regulator you destroy, and 100 points for each astronaut that is rescued. After running out of oxygen on the ninth ship, the game will end.  There are no bonus ships in this game, so tread carefully! Go for the high score! 

The Latest Version is 1.11 [6/29/2022]

I tightened up the ship movement control (it's no longer frame based).

I added automatic firing as an option.  Push left or right on the title screen to turn it on or off.  The game will default back to 'off' when turned on, reset, or the game ends.

Your ship is reset to the bottom dock area when it explodes.

The astronaut at the top of the screen will now move back and forth and is animated.

Bonuses were added.  If you rescue at least 4 spacemen on a single ship, you will receive a 300 point bonus after the oxygen is depleted on the ship you're on.  If you rescue 8 or more, there is a 600 point bonus. 

Rescuing an astronaut (picking him up and taking him to the bottom dock area) will now give you a small oxygen bonus, increasing the time you have available on the ship.
The security gate will flash when you are getting low on oxygen, so you have an additional visual indicator when the time is almost up.
